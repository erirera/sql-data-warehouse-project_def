-- DATA STANDARDIZATION & CONSISTENCY 
-- removing unwanted spaces, maps coded values to meaningful, 
-- user-friendly descriptions (i.e. data normalization & standardization)
-- handling missing values (fill in the blanks by adding a default value)
-- ensuring only one record per entity by removing duplicates (identify and retaining the most relevant rows.
--(in doing this, there may be need to increase the character-length of the target columns)
